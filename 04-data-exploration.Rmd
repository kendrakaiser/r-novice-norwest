```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r}
temps <- read.csv(file = "data/stream-temps.csv", stringsAsFactors=TRUE)
temps
```

## Saving time by using scripts
dates <- as.Date(temps$MonthYear[1], "%m-%Y")


```{r}
plot(temps$MonthYear[temps$NoRWeST_ID == 'MidSnake_174'], temps$MonthlyMean[temps$NoRWeST_ID == 'MidSnake_174'])
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```
